Transitions MAX By MArio Flores G.



This Code demostrates some Functions that can be done using Direct Show... 
You can Do Transitions and Effects,...<<<>>>> It only Display's the one's you have Installed 
on your system(CLSID Classes Id's Registered on Windows ),but Still it's Nice,and you can always
install a new Effect or Transition ...


If you select a transition that is not installed on your machine,then the default "Slide" transition 
will be used instead.

-You can Select The Delay time in the slides
-Select form Effect or Transition Mode
-Display Slide in Full Size (may be a ScreenSaver? ...need's some code)
-select one folder that has pictures or images (Use Browse function)
-You can alway's Pause and Playe again
-Cool interface Style(Yes its Media Player Skin..But who cares its Cool)...
 Normal Window and Tranparent
-The Code needs some fixes (Thats the reason it's on the web),but right now im working on it.
-Its easy to export the Slides into a AVI file...yust a few lines...if you whant the code e-mail me

I Rebuild this Code From SDK help...did some Work to make it more easy to use,Added more transitions
and made it  more easy I think,And the Transparency Code Author its mentioned in the module (cDIBSection)... 
This Code is Free!..and you  must keep it that way.


I am Working on the Display Quality because is poor ,if you know how  to fix this please comment...
I don't know if its because resolution colud be NTSC 352 X 240...????and streched(Resized) the window pixelate???


.....<<<IMPORTANT>> this code only works in High Color 16 (Bits) ,not in 32 True Color(Very Bad Graphics)


TO WORK:


----Direct X (8 or Above 'i think)
----Reference Dexter 1.0 Type Library in your proyect                     '''' QEDIT.DLL
----Reference Active Movie control type Library in your proyect           '''' QUARTZ.DLL

TO PLAY:

----Look For a Folder thst has Picutes(Browse)
----Select one Transition(...Default is Slide....) or Effect... !!!!BTW "basics" Transitions is a random of Power Point Transitions Style(Not the same!)
----Click Play Button

...Enjoy!!!!

The DirectX Media 6 SDK includes several third-party transitions in the form
of DirectX Transforms.  To enable these transitions, you can install the 
DirectX Media 6 SDK, which is available only on the DirectX 7.0a CD-ROM.  
You can order this CD-ROM by following the "DirectX 7.0a SDK CD-ROM" link on 
http://www.microsoft.com/directx/dxmedia.
